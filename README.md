# Stock_Prediction_Using_RNNs

The goal of this project was to see if it possible to train RNNs to predict stock market results.
This was to be done using and comparing GRU and LSTM recurrent neural networks. The
experiments were done on Appleâ€™s stock and using the VIX and Nasdasq indices to perform the
prediction.

## Hyperparameter Search

To run a Hyperparameter search, simply uncomment the commented cell with the comment "#Hyperparameter training."
in the RNN training part of the notebok and the cells in Hyperparameter Plotting part.
